        <h1>Gladiators</h1>
        <div>
            In ancient Rome Gladiators were professional combatants who traditionally performed at funerals. The idea
            being that the deceased would have armed fighters to bring with them to the afterlife. This is originally
            why fights were to the death.Gladiator shows originally started with a few fighters and lasted only a few
            days but by the time of Emperor Titus and the Colosseum Gladiator shows could go for over a hundred days
            with thousands of fighters.

            <h2>Types of Gladiators</h2>
            There was variety of different Gladiators that fought during the games.
            The Samnites carried a short sword and large oblong shield. They wore a visor and a plumed helmet.
            The Thraces or ‘Thracians’ carried a small round buckler as a shield and carried a curved dagger. They
            usually fought the Mirmillones.
            The Mirmillones were armed liked a traditional Gallic fighter, with a helmet, sword and shield. They
            received their name from the fish they used as their crest.
            The Retiarius (“net man”) and the Secutor (“pursuer”) were paired together. The Secutor was fully armed but
            the Retiarius only had a net to entangle his pursuer. If the Retiarius was successful with his net he was
            allowed to use a trident to dispatch his opponent.
            The Andabatae were fighters who fought on horseback and worn helmets with visors that restricted their
            vision.
            The Dimachaeri (“two-knife men”) carried a small short sword in each hand.
            The Essedarii (chariot men) fought from the back of a chariot.
            The Hoplomachi (“fighters in armour”) fought in a complete suit of armour.
            The laquearrii (“lasso men”) would use lassos to try and trap their opponent.

            <h2>The Show</h2>
            About a week before the games began announcements were made with bills attached to public places and
            sometimes sold in the market with the dates of the games and the names of the participants. The event would
            begin with a procession of the gladiators through the arena followed by a mock fight with wooden weapons.
            (praelusio, prolusio). The sound of the trumpet meant the real fighting began.
            Once a Gladiator was wounded the crowd would shout “Habet” (they are wounded) and the life of the wounded
            gladiator would be in the hands of their advisory and the crowd.
            It is thought that the crowd would signal to the victories combatant if they wanted the defeated fighter to
            be killed or allowed to live though what signal they gave is up for debate.
            One popular theory is that if the spectators wanted the gladiator to be killed they would turn their thumbs
            down and if they wanted them to live they would wave their handkerchiefs. Other however, believe that if the
            spectators wanted the gladiators to be killed they would point their thumbs towards their chest in a ‘stab
            them’ like gesture and that if they wanted them to live they would give a thumbs down, meaning drop your
            weapon.
            If a gladiator was victorious they could earn branches of palm and sometimes even money. If a gladiator
            survived a certain number of combats they may have also been granted their freedom.

            <h2>Female Gladiators</h2>
            Though not as popular as male gladiators there is clear evidence that some women also became Gladiators.
            Ancient Roman marble in the British museum depicts two female gladiators battling with swords and shields.
            An inscription over their heads indicates they fought to a draw. It is believed many other works may also
            depict female gladiators but have been misinterpreted. It is also believed that that women from a variety of
            social backgrounds fought in the games from enslaved women to wealthier middle class women.

            <h2>The End of Gladiators </h2>
            The owning and hiring of gladiators was a large branch of commerce in ancient Rome but as time went on the
            idea of gladiators became less popular. As Christianity spread the interest in Gladiators began to dissolve.
            Emperor Constantine abolished gladiator games in 325 AD but they still continued on and were abolished again
            by the Emperor Honorius, though they may have continued for a century after that.
