# Learn About the Colosseum
The purpose of this website is to give information to those who are interested in the Colosseum. The landing page has some quick facts to get the user engaged and the History and Gladiator section go more indepth into the creation of the structure, how it was used and the combatants that fought in it.

The main goal is to educate the user on the Colosseum but the secondary goal is for the user to visit, or possibly re-visit the Colosseum. The information on the first three pages will hopefully entice the user to consider visiting. The Visit page will give the user specific reasons to visit the Colosseum and a form if they have any questions about tours or general questions.

## UX

The design of the website is trying to evoke the image of ancient Rome with dark orange colours to represent sand and brick of the Colosseum.

### Colour Scheme


- `#c17226` used for primary text.
- `#ad5500` used for secondary text.
- `#fafafa` used for secondary highlights.

### Typography

Philiosopher and Mulish fonts were used as they pair well together and fit the theme. They were taken from Google Fonts. The social media links were taken from Font Awesome. l

- [Philiosopher](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Philosopher?query=philosopher) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Mulish](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish?query=Mulish) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

In this section, list all of your user stories for the project.

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to see the title of the page at the top, so that I can always know what page I'm on.
- As a new site user, I would like to have a navigation bar, so that I can navigate to each page easily.
- As a new site user, I would like to have a form section, so that I can send a question to the site creator.
- As a new site user, I would like to have a confirmation page, so that I can know my question was sent correctly.

## Wireframes

For this site I created wireframes to give me a rough guide for the actual site.

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Features
### Existing Features

- **Nav Bar/Title**

    - Each page has a title to show the user what page they are on. The navigation bar below the heading allows the use to quickly navigate to other parts of the site. Each link will change its background colour on hover to give visual feedback to the user about the link they are about to click.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-nav.png)

- **Burger Menu**

    - If the site is on a screen below 600px width then the nav bar will become a burger menu. This will allow the user to quickly navigate to other parts of the site when needed but will not take up excessive space when the nav bar is not being used.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-burger.png)

- **Greyscale**

    - Each page has multiple images to keep the user engaged and to give them a visual reference. The greyscale adds a touch of interactivity to the user.

    ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-greyscale.png)

    - **Timeline**

    - On the index page there is a timeline to at the bottom of the page to give the user a easy to read visual aid to give them a brief overview of the Colosseum before they go to the more in depth sections.

    ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-timeline.png)

    - **Information**

    - The main purpose of the site is to allow users to learn about the Colosseum. Detailed information blocks with images will help the user learn more about the structure and its history.

     ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-info.png)

    - **Footer**

    - The footer on each page is clearly marked with a colour change. The icons in the footer use clear icons as links so that the user can quickly navigate to different social media platforms.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-footer.png)

- **Form**

    - The visit page has a form for users to fill in if they have any questions about the Colosseum or how to visit. 

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-form.png)

- **Confirmation Page**

    - To assure the user their question has been sent a confirmation page will thank them and confirm the message has been sent.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-confirmation.png)

### Future Features

- Quiz Page #1
    - In the future I think it would be fun to have a quiz section for users to test what they have learned.
- Image carousel #2
    - I would like to add an image carousel to the index page so that users could scroll through more images.
