# Learn About the Colosseum
The purpose of this website is to give information to those who are interested in the Colosseum. The landing page has some quick facts to get the user engaged and the History and Gladiator section go more indepth into the creation of the structure, how it was used and the combatants that fought in it.

The main goal is to educate the user on the Colosseum but the secondary goal is for the user to visit, or possibly re-visit the Colosseum. The information on the first three pages will hopefully entice the user to consider visiting. The Visit page will give the user specific reasons to visit the Colosseum and a form if they have any questions about tours or general questions.
