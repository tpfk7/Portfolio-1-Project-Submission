        <h2>Creating The Colosseum</h2> 
        <br>
            <p>

                Almost two thousand years ago the infamous roman emperor Nero took his own life plunging Rome into
                chaos. In just one year after Nero’s death four different emperors had taken to the throne. The fourth
                however, Vespain, would end up ruling for 10 years followed by his sons and Domitian would be known as
                the Flavian emperors. In the year 70 AD Vespain took the lush land in the center of Rome where Nero had
                a palace and returned it to the people.

                He decided that on that piece of land he would erect an amphitheater where the public could go to view
                gladiator games and other forms of entertainment. (for free)

                After ten years of construction Vespians son Titus officially opened the Colosseum. The Colosseum opened
                with 100 days of games. The Colosseum, as well as the handling of the Vesuvius disaster cemented Titus
                as a well loved ruler. It was his brother however, Domitian, who would oversee the final construction of
                the Colosseum.

            <h2>The Centerpiece of Rome</h2>
            <br>
            <p>

                The largest amphitheater in the Roman empire, the Colosseum was (and still is) a site to behold. Unlike
                many other amphitheaters at the time that were built into a hillside for support the Colosseum was
                freestanding. It had a total of about 80 arched entrances supported by large semi-circular columns. The
                structure was three stories tall with columns of a different style on each story.

                50,000 people could be seated in the Colosseum, most likely arranged by social class. Though it is
                thought the Colosseum would have been tightly packed it also had its comforts. During a particularly hot
                day awnings would be unfurled to protect the spectators from the hot sun while they watched a variety of
                entertainment including gladiator fights, animal hunts, animal combat, executions and even mock naval
                battles in which the Colosseum would be flooded with water. (at a great expense) The majority of fighter
                in the Colosseum were men though there were some women too. Click here to learn more about the

            <h2>The Colosseum through Time</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                
                The Colosseum was used for almost 400 years. With new struggles in the western Roman empire and a change
                in public interests the costly Colosseum put an end to most of its events by the 6th century AD. The
                structure had also suffered damage due to natural disasters over that time such as lightening and
                earthquakes.
                As time went on the Colosseum was no longer a marvel of Rome and was used a quarry for multiple
                buildings such as Cathedrals and fortifications. It wasn’t until the 18th century that a strong desire
                to preserve the Colosseum began to arise mostly from the different popes who thought the site should be
                preserved as a monument to Christian martyrs. Though the theory of early christians being killed in the
                Colosseum has been called into question in recent years.
                As time went on the Colosseum was hit with more natural disasters, vandalism and weathering. Nearly two
                thirds of the original Colosseum had been destroyed but in the 1990s restoration efforts began and have
                continued. Today the Colosseum is a leading tourist attraction that people from all over the world come
                to see. Click here to find out why you should plan to visit this historic structure.
